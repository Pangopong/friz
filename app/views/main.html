<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
  The VTS system uses multiple components (hardware, software, sensors) and provides basic functionality, interfaces and integration capabilities such as:
<br><br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
Multi sensor processing (Radar, AIS, RDF, CCTV, Meteo)<br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
Advanced radar and data processing<br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
User-friendly Traffic Display System, GIS centric<br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
Integrated recording & replay (data/voice)<br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
Vessel Traffic Management System (VTMIS = VTS + Database)<br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
Traffic simulation tools for training purposes<br><br>
All IT Safesea VTMS components can be configured to build systems ranging from small to very large ones, due to its modular design and the ability to interface other sensors like AIS, RDF and meteorological sensors.
<br><br>
To increase the safety in the movement area a Conflict Detection unit is an essential part of the IT Safesea system to allow for automatic detection of future potential traffic conflicts or situations.
<br><br>
The Conflict Detection is based on the evaluation and prediction of the movement of tracks obtained by processing the sensor data and topology data (restricted areas, etc.) the traffic situation is analyzed to trigger configured events and traffic rule infringements, such as:
<br><br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
A track crossing an active guard line<br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
A track entering an active guard ring or a guard area<br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
A track leaving a buoy ring or a swing circle<br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
A track exceeding an area specific speed limit<br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
A track entering an active prohibited or restricted area<br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
A track entering a special area slaved to another track (area collision conflict)<br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
Two selected tracks can be on collision course, etc.<br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></span>
Synchronized REPLAY function using GIS, video and voice records<br><br>
Together with C.S.R. (Centrul pentru Servicii de Radio-comunica≈£ii), one of the well known system integrator on the Romanian market, the IT Safesea has been implemented at Romanian Naval Authority, for Constanza harbor.<br>
